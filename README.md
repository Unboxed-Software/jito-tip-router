# NCN Program Template

## Program Summary

The NCN (Network Consensus Node) Program is a Solana program designed for reaching consensus on weather status in a decentralized network. It manages the collection, voting, and consensus mechanisms across vaults and operators in the ecosystem, leveraging Jito's restaking infrastructure.

Key features:
- Stake-weighted voting mechanism (66% consensus threshold)
- Epoch-based consensus cycles
- Support for multiple stake token mints with configurable weights
- Weather status system (Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy)
- Admin controls for configuration and tie-breaking

## Testing Setup

### Prerequisites

1. Set up test-ledger: `./scripts/setup-test-ledger.sh`
2. Build the ncn program: `cargo build-sbf --manifest-path program/Cargo.toml --sbf-out-dir integration_tests/tests/fixtures`
3. Run tests: `SBF_OUT_DIR=integration_tests/tests/fixtures cargo test`

## Usage Flow

1. **Initialize** the program with configuration, vault registry, and core accounts
2. **Setup Epochs** by creating epoch state and weight tables for each consensus period
3. **Create Snapshots** of operators and vaults to establish voting weights
4. **Cast Votes** on weather status with influence based on stake weight
5. **Achieve Consensus** when votes for a status reach â‰¥66% of total stake weight
6. **Record Results** with the winning status, voting statistics, and timing data
7. **Clean Up** accounts after sufficient time has passed to reclaim rent

## Customization

While this implementation uses weather status as the consensus target, the framework can be adapted for various applications:
- Replace weather status with other vote data
- Modify consensus thresholds
- Adjust epoch and timing parameters
- Implement custom reward distribution logic
